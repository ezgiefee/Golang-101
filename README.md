# Why to choose Go
* Simple Syntax : The syntax is simple and concise. 
* Concurrency : Writing multithreaded programs is easy by using Goroutines and channels
* Compiled Language : The source code is compiled to a native binary and the Go compiler is designed to be fast.
* Static Linking : The Go compiler supports static linking. The entire Go project can be statically linked into one big binary and it can be deployed easily. 
* Garbage Collection: Go uses garbage collection and hence memory management is pretty much taken care automatically and the developer doesn't need to worry about managing memory. This also helps to write concurrent programs easily.
