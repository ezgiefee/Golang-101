# Golang-101
This is a repository to learn Go programming language 

# Why to choose Go
* Simple Syntax : The syntax is simple and concise. 
* Concurrency : Writing multithreaded programs is easy by using Goroutines and channels
* Compiled Language : The source code is compiled to a native binary file and the Go compiler is designed to be fast.
* Static Linking : The Go compiler supports static linking. The entire Go project can be statically linked into one big binary and it can be deployed easily. 
* Garbage Collection: Go uses garbage collection and hence memory management is pretty much taken care automatically and the developer doesn't need to worry about managing memory. This also helps to write concurrent programs easily.

# Download and Install Go
Visit https://go.dev/doc/install to download and install the appropriate installer. After you follow the instructions, check if it is installed by typing *go version* on a terminal window. If Go isnâ€™t already being found by the CLI you have to manually add */usr/local/go/bin* to the PATH variable of your system.
